# 🚀 Exercise 07: Add to Index using Push API

## 📋 Project Concept

This exercise demonstrates how to optimize bulk data indexing in Azure Cognitive Search using the **Push API**. The project focuses on:

- 📊 **Batch Size Optimization**: Testing different batch sizes to find optimal performance
- ⚡ **Exponential Backoff Strategy**: Implementing retry logic to handle rate limiting
- 🔄 **Concurrent Processing**: Using multiple threads for parallel document uploads
- 📈 **Performance Monitoring**: Measuring throughput and efficiency metrics

The main goal is to efficiently upload large volumes of documents (100,000+ hotel records) to Azure Cognitive Search while maintaining optimal performance and handling service limitations gracefully.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Deployment

### 📝 Azure Resources Explanation

This template deploys the following resources:

- 💾 **Azure Storage Account**: For storing documents and data
- 🔍 **Azure Cognitive Search Service**: The search engine for indexing and querying
- 🧠 **Azure Cognitive Services Account**: For AI-powered content enrichment

It uses a `resourcePrefix` parameter to generate consistent naming for all services.

⚠️ **Important**: The prefix must contain only lowercase letters and numbers. No dashes (-) are allowed because storage account names must follow strict naming rules.

### 🤔 Why Include Storage Account if We're Not Using It in This Exercise?

**💡 Answer**: In this specific exercise, we are **NOT** using the Storage Account for performance testing. The data is generated **in-memory** and pushed directly to the search index using the **Push API**.

However, the Storage Account is included in the deployment template for several important reasons:

#### 🔮 **1. Placeholder for Future Use**
Many Azure AI Search scenarios require a Storage Account to:
- 📄 Store raw data files (JSON, CSV, images, PDFs)
- 🔄 Hold intermediate files during ETL or enrichment processes
- 📤 Store enriched output files
- 🎯 So having storage ready is a common preparation step

#### 🏭 **2. Azure Data Factory (ADF) Dependency**
If you plan to use ADF later for push-style ingestion, it relies on Storage Accounts to:
- 📦 Stage temporary data
- 🔧 Support integration runtime storage

#### 🔗 **3. Support for Blob Data Sources in Search**
If your data source is Azure Blob Storage, the Search service expects a Storage Account to connect to, even if it's empty at first.

#### 🎛️ **4. Uniform Naming & Automation**
When you build your infrastructure as code, including all potentially needed resources together:
- 🚀 Simplifies deployment (one template, one deployment)
- 📏 Keeps resource naming consistent
- 🔄 Helps manage environment reproducibility (dev, test, prod)

#### ♻️ **5. Makes the Template More Reusable**
Including Storage Account from the start lets you reuse the same template across different projects or environments without modifying it.

### 📊 **Current Exercise Data Flow**
```
🔢 Generated Data (In-Memory) → 🚀 Push API → 🔍 Azure Search Index
```
**No Storage Account involvement in this performance test!**

### 📌 How to Deploy via Azure Portal (No CLI Required)

1. 🌐 Go to **Azure Portal** → **Deploy a custom template**
2. 🔧 Click **"Build your own template in the editor"**
3. 📋 Paste the ARM template from `azuredeploy.json` into the editor
4. 💾 Click **Save**
5. 📝 Fill in the required parameters:
   - 📁 **Resource Group** (choose existing or create a new one)
   - 🏷️ **resourcePrefix** (e.g., `myapp1`)
   - 📍 **Location**, **SKU**, etc.
6. ✅ Click **Review + Create**, then **Create**

### 💻 CLI Alternative (Optional)

✅ This is equivalent to using Azure CLI:

#### 1️⃣ Create a resource group:
```bash
az group create --name my-rg --location "East US"
```

#### 2️⃣ Deploy the template:
```bash
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group my-rg \
  --template-file ./azuredeploy.json \
  --parameters resourcePrefix=myapp1 location="East US"
```

🎯 **Note**: The Portal method provides a UI interface instead of command line, but achieves the exact same result.

## 🛠️ Project Setup and Requirements

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Azure Subscription** with sufficient credits
- ✅ **.NET 8.0 SDK** installed
- ✅ **Azure Cognitive Search Service** deployed
- ✅ **Admin API Key** from your search service
- ✅ **Service Endpoint URL**

### ⚙️ Configuration Setup

1. 📁 Navigate to the `OptimizeDataIndexing` folder
2. 📝 Open `appsettings.json`
3. 🔧 Update the following values:

```json
{
  "SearchServiceUri": "https://your-service-name.search.windows.net",
  "SearchServiceAdminApiKey": "your-admin-api-key-here",
  "SearchIndexName": "optimize-indexing"
}
```

### 🔑 Getting Your API Key

1. 🌐 Go to **Azure Portal**
2. 🔍 Find your **Azure Cognitive Search** service
3. 🔑 Navigate to **Settings** → **Keys**
4. 📋 Copy the **Primary admin key**

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 📂 Step 1: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd /workspaces/mslearn-knowledge-mining/Labfiles/07-exercise-add-to-index-use-push-api/OptimizeDataIndexing
```

### 🔧 Step 2: Restore Dependencies
```bash
dotnet restore
```

### ▶️ Step 3: Run the Application
```bash
dotnet run
```

## 📊 What the Application Does

### 🔄 Execution Flow

1. 🗑️ **Index Cleanup**: Deletes existing index (if any)
2. 🏗️ **Index Creation**: Creates a new search index based on Hotel schema
3. 📊 **Batch Testing** (Optional): Tests different batch sizes for optimization
4. 📤 **Data Upload**: Uploads 100,000 hotel documents using optimized settings
5. ✅ **Validation**: Confirms all documents were indexed successfully

### 📈 Performance Metrics

The application tracks and displays:

- ⏱️ **Upload Time**: Total time for batch processing
- 📊 **Throughput**: Documents processed per second
- 💾 **Batch Efficiency**: Time per batch and per document
- 🔢 **Document Count**: Final indexed document count
- 💽 **Storage Size**: Total index storage usage

### 🎯 Expected Results

With optimal settings, you should see:

- **⚡ Throughput**: ~4,900+ documents per second
- **⏱️ Processing Time**: ~20-25 seconds for 100,000 documents
- **🔀 Concurrency**: 8 parallel threads
- **📦 Optimal Batch Size**: 1,000 documents per batch

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Common Issues

1. **🔐 Authentication Error**:
   - ✅ Verify your API key is correct
   - ✅ Ensure the service endpoint URL is accurate

2. **🌐 Connection Timeout**:
   - ✅ Check your internet connection
   - ✅ Verify the search service is running

3. **💰 Rate Limiting (429 errors)**:
   - ✅ The exponential backoff will handle this automatically
   - ✅ Consider reducing batch size if persistent

4. **⚠️ Compiler Warning**:
   ```
   warning CS0168: The variable 'ex' is declared but never used
   ```
   - ✅ This is harmless and can be ignored

### 🔍 Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging, you can modify the application to show more verbose output during execution.
