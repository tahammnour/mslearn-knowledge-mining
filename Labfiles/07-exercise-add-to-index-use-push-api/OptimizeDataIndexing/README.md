```

This table shows the performance characteristics of different batch sizes:
- **Batch Size**: Number of documents uploaded per batch
- **Size in MB**: Total size of the batch in megabytes
- **MB / Doc**: Average size per document
- **Time (ms)**: Time taken to upload the batch in milliseconds
- **MB / Second**: Throughput rate (megabytes per second)

**🎯 Key Observations**: The optimal batch size appears to be around 1000 documents, providing the best throughput at 4.912 MB/second.

### ⚡ Exponential Backoff Upload Output
The application uploads 100,000 documents using an optimized approach:
- **Started at**: 06/03/2025 20:56:20
- **Ended at**: 06/03/2025 20:56:41
- **Total Upload Time**: 00:00:20.3570109 (approximately 20.4 seconds)
- **Upload time per batch**: 203.5701 ms
- **Upload time per document**: 0.2036 ms

The output shows the application using 8 concurrent threads, each processing batches of 1000 documents, demonstrating efficient parallel processing.

### 📋 Final Statistics
- **Document Count**: 100,000 documents successfully indexed
- **Storage Size**: 71,558,433 bytes (approximately 71.6 MB)

## 💻 Code Structure

### 📁 Program.cs Overview

The main program file contains several key methods:

#### 🔧 Main Method
- Loads configuration from `appsettings.json`
- Creates Azure Search clients
- Deletes existing index (if any)
- Creates a new search index
- Generates test data (100,000 hotel documents)
- Uploads data using exponential backoff strategy
- Validates the upload was successful

#### 🔑 Key Methods

1. **🗑️ DeleteIndexIfExistsAsync**: Safely deletes an existing index to ensure a clean start
2. **🏗️ CreateIndexAsync**: Creates a new search index based on the Hotel class structure
3. **📊 TestBatchSizesAsync**: Tests different batch sizes to find optimal performance (commented out in current run)
4. **🔄 ExponentialBackoff.IndexDataAsync**: Implements the optimized upload strategy with retry logic
5. **✅ ValidateIndexAsync**: Confirms all documents were successfully indexed

### ⚙️ appsettings.json Configuration

```json
{
  "SearchServiceUri": "https://{service-name}.search.windows.net",
  "SearchServiceAdminApiKey": "",
  "SearchIndexName": "optimize-indexing"
}
```

**📝 Configuration Parameters**:
- **🌐 SearchServiceUri**: The endpoint URL for your Azure Cognitive Search service
- **🔐 SearchServiceAdminApiKey**: The admin API key for authentication
- **📇 SearchIndexName**: The name of the search index to create/use

**⚠️ Note**: You need to replace `{service-name}` with your actual search service name and provide a valid API key.

## ✨ Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. 📏 Batch Size Optimization
The application can test different batch sizes to determine the optimal number of documents to upload in a single request, balancing throughput and service limits.

### 2. 🔄 Exponential Backoff Strategy
Implements retry logic with exponential backoff to handle rate limiting (HTTP 429 responses) gracefully, ensuring reliable data upload even under heavy load.

### 3. 🚀 Concurrent Processing
Uses multiple threads (8 in this example) to upload batches in parallel, significantly improving overall throughput.

### 4. ✅ Data Validation
Includes validation steps to ensure all documents were successfully indexed and retrieves final statistics about the index.

## 🏆 Performance Results

The application successfully uploaded 100,000 documents in approximately 20.4 seconds, achieving:
- **⚡ Throughput**: ~4,902 documents per second
- **⏱️ Efficiency**: 0.2036 ms per document
- **🔀 Concurrency**: 8 parallel threads
- **📦 Batch Size**: 1000 documents per batch

This demonstrates an optimized approach for bulk data indexing in Azure Cognitive Search, making it suitable for large-scale data migration scenarios.

## ⚠️ Warning Note

The application shows a compiler warning:
```
warning CS0168: The variable 'ex' is declared but never used
```
This occurs in `ExponentialBackoff.cs` line 66 and can be safely ignored or fixed by using the exception variable or removing it if not needed.
